# # Bank-Loan-Approval-ML

This project predicts whether a bank loan will be approved or not using a Machine Learning model trained on customer demographic and financial details.
It helps banks automate loan screening, saving time and improving consistency in decision-making.

# Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies loan applications as Approved (Y) or Rejected (N) based on features like income, education, credit history, and employment.

# Model Description

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Why: Offers transparency, high recall, and interpretability—ideal for financial decision systems.

# Performance:

Accuracy: 86.18%
Precision: 84.00%
Recall: 98.82%
F1-Score: 90.81%
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized loan approvals by education, income, and property area.
Found credit history as the strongest predictor of approval.

# Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.
Created new engineered features: Total_Income, Income_to_Loan_Ratio.

# Model Training & Evaluation:

Trained multiple models and selected Logistic Regression for best F1-score.

# Prediction:

The model predicts “Y” (approved) or “N” (rejected) for new loan applications.

# Chosen Metric

F1-Score (90.81%) — chosen because it balances precision (avoiding bad loans) and recall (not missing good applicants).
This ensures the bank’s decision system is both safe and inclusive.

# Application

Banks can integrate this model to:
Automatically pre-screen applicants
Reduce manual workload by 60–70%
Make consistent, data-driven loan decisions
Improve customer experience through faster processing

# Tech Stack

Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
